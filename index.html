            <h1 class="title">Life of Bhagat Singh</h1>
            <P>
            Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary, who
            participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928 in what was to be
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of
            the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic
            coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his
            execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and
            anarchism, the charismatic Singh electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted
            urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for
            India's independence.</p>

           <p> In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary
            group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British
            police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was
            still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to
            assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala
            Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died
            of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet
            fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at close range
            several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh,
            Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase
            as Singh and Rajguru fled.</P>
